	<h1 class="article-title">Ukulele Tuesday: Songs Data Analysis App</h1>

	<p class="article-subtitle">
		This project was developed as part of my Master's in Business Analytics at the UCD Michael Smurfit Business School. It was a group project for the Python programming course, where we designed and implemented a data analysis tool tailored to the needs of Ukulele Tuesday, a vibrant community of ukulele enthusiasts in Dublin.

	<h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
	<p class="article-content">
		Ukulele Tuesday manages a rich database of songs played during their weekly gatherings. This data spans three CSV files:
		<ul>
			<li>tabdb.csv: A database with song metadata (e.g., title, year, difficulty).</li>
			<li>playdb.csv: Records of when songs were played during weekly sessions.</li>
			<li>requestdb.csv: Logs of who requested specific songs (e.g., audience or group).</li>
		</ul>
		The group needed a Python program to:
		<ol>
			<li>Query and filter this data easily based on song attributes or play dates.</li>
			<li>Visualize trends and patterns in their song collection using clear and interactive charts.</li>
			<li>Provide a user-friendly interface while handling errors gracefully.</li>
		</ol>
		These functionalities would help them improve their playlists and make data-driven decisions about their performances.
	</p>

	<h2>Developing the Solution</h2>
	<p class="article-content">
		As a team, we collaborated to design and build a robust solution, ensuring it met the group’s requirements while showcasing our skills in Python and data analytics.
		<div class="center-responsive">
			<img src="images/projects/app1.png" alt="Centered Image" style="width: 700px; height: 300px;"/>
		</div><br/>
		<h3>Core Features</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Dynamic Querying:</strong> The tool allows users to filter songs by attributes like difficulty, year, language, and date range. Results are displayed in customizable tables, making data exploration easy and intuitive.</li>
			<li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> The program checks for missing columns, incorrect data types, and invalid file paths, ensuring a smooth user experience.</li>
			<li><strong>Interactive Outputs:</strong> Results are displayed in tables where users can customize columns and sort the data.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="center-responsive">

		</div><br/>

		<h3>Data Visualizations</h3>
		To make the data more actionable, the tool generates several plots using matplotlib:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Histograms:</strong> Distribution of song difficulty levels, Distribution of song durations.</li>
			<li><strong>Bar Charts:</strong> Songs grouped by language, Songs grouped by decade, Songs grouped by tab source (e.g., new, old, or offline).</li>
			<li><strong>Line Charts:</strong> Cumulative trends of songs played over time.</li>
			<li><strong>Pie Charts:</strong> Gender distribution of lead vocalists.</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="center-responsive">
			<img src="images/projects/app3.png" alt="Centered Image" style="width: 700px; height: 300px;"/>
		</div><br/>
		These visualizations allowed Ukulele Tuesday to quickly identify popular trends, analyze diversity in their collection, and make strategic adjustments to their song selection.

		<h2>Results and Impact</h2>
		<p class="article-content">
			The program delivered significant value to Ukulele Tuesday by transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Some key outcomes include:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Better Playlist Management:</strong> They can now identify frequently played or rarely requested songs and make more informed decisions about their weekly performances.</li>
				<li><strong>Deeper Insights:</strong> Visualizations revealed patterns such as the dominance of certain song languages and variations in song difficulty levels, helping the group maintain a balanced and engaging collection.</li>
				<li><strong>Ease of Use:</strong> With a clean interface and robust error handling, the tool was intuitive even for users with minimal technical expertise.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			<h2>Reflections and Future Improvements</h2>
			<p class="article-content">
				This project not only met the group’s requirements but also demonstrated our ability to deliver user-focused solutions. While the tool is fully functional, there are opportunities for future enhancements:
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Automated Reports:</strong> The ability to generate PDF summaries of visualizations for easier sharing.</li>
					<li><strong>Advanced Filtering:</strong> Adding more dynamic filters, such as grouping data by custom categories.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

				<h2>Final Thoughts & Privacy Note</h2>
				<p class="article-content">
					This group project demonstrates not only my technical skills in Python and data visualization but also my ability to collaborate effectively and deliver practical solutions in a real-world context. It was a nice experience, combining technical challenges with user-centered design.<br/><br/>
					For privacy reasons, the datasets used in this project cannot be shared. However, I am available to provide further details about the project and discuss the methodology, technical implementation, and key insights upon request.
